Project "LEDButton"
Authors: Fabio Hedayioglu, Ian Utting and Michael KÃ¶lling

This project is part of the material for the tutorial for BlueJ on the Raspberry Pi.

It is Part of the first and second tutorial: GPIO: LED and GPIO: Button.

This is a simple object to demonstrate the use of an LED and a Button 
connected to the Raspberry Pi using GPIOs.

You can manipulate LEDs and Buttons and interact with them either interactively
or programatically, by editing the class Controller.

This project is designed in such a way to make the manipulation of LEDs and Buttons 
very easy and straightfoward, making it accessible even to the novice programmer.

All the implementation details are isolated to the user, in order to make the 
teaching and use of the LED and Button classes completely free from low level details.

The LED and Button classes are flexible and can be used in general purpose projects.
